## What is it? 

My exclusive interationalised Portfolio website. 



## What technologies does the project use?

The website is a static multiple language single page application written using HTML, React JS, and eventually Tailwind as the UI framework.



## Some elaborations

- ***Fonts***: Two distinct font-families are used for Persian vs. English/German versions; El Messiri as well as Montserrat.
- ***Internationalization***: i18n method is implemented so that the wesbite is available in 3 languages
- ***The direction***: The  direction of each language's page is dynamically set based on the value provided by the i18n and certain html attributes are exempt from this rule by the strict use of inline classes to override the setDirection() method
